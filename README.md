# Uniswap v4 Take Profits Hook

This code is part of a lesson at LearnWeb3 teaching how to build hooks for Uniswap v4. In this example, we build a hook that allows users to place 'take-profit' positions. For example, in an ETH/DAI pool if currently 1 ETH = 1500 DAI, you could place a take-profit order as "sell all my ETH when 1 ETH = 2000 DAI" which will be executed automatically.

This code is inspired from https://github.com/saucepoint/v4-stoploss stop-loss orders, with slight differences.
